## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-29

First public release. Asset Manager is a custom Home Assistant
integration that turns arbitrary physical assets into first-class HA
devices with user-defined entities, templates, cloning, and derived
sensors — fully UI-driven, no YAML.

### Added

- **Assets as HA devices** — each asset becomes a Device Registry
  entry identified by `[("asset_manager", asset_id)]`, with name,
  manufacturer, model, serial, icon, and HA labels.
- **User-defined entities** — attach entities of 8 kinds to any asset:
  `number`, `sensor`, `date`, `text`, `select`, `button`, `switch`,
  and `derived`. Entity unique IDs are `{asset_id}-{slug}`, preserving
  identity across renames. Configurable per kind (min/max/step/mode,
  options, device_class/state_class, formula, etc.).
- **Templates** — reusable entity blueprints with their own icon and
  labels. Bundled presets: Vehicle, Battery, Generic Sensor, and more.
  Apply a template to a new asset in one click; template labels merge
  onto the asset's device.
- **Clone** — duplicate an asset including its entities and labels;
  assign a new name. Great for fleet tracking.
- **Derived sensors** — define a sensor whose value is a formula over
  other entities on the same asset. Safe formula evaluator (no
  `eval`): supports arithmetic, comparison, and date functions.
  Recalculation is event-driven plus a midnight tick for date math.
- **Native HA labels integration** — assets use HA's built-in label
  registry. New bespoke WS commands `get_asset_labels` and
  `update_asset_labels` (full-replace). Clone copies source device
  labels. Panel subscribes to `label_registry_updated` for live
  refresh.
- **Frontend panel** — sidebar panel built as modular ES modules (no
  build step). List view with sortable columns, multi-property
  filters (area, manufacturer, model, entity count, icon, labels),
  search, and column picker. Detail view with entity management.
  Templates view with CRUD editor. Live updates via collection
  subscribe.
- **Native HA form elements** — panel uses `ha-input`, `ha-select`,
  `ha-textarea`, and `ha-icon-picker` with automatic fallback to flat
  `.am-*` elements on older HA builds. New `native-fields.js` wrapper
  module; `h()` helper extended with `.`-prefix property support for
  Lit elements.
- **Clickable rows** — asset list and template list rows are fully
  clickable with hover state; action buttons stop propagation.
- **Error UX** — voluptuous validation errors surfaced inline in
  dialogs per field instead of generic toasts.
- **Config flow** — single-instance config flow (no options); creates
  one config entry and registers the panel.
- **Backup note** — all data stored in `.storage/asset_manager/`
  (assets, entities, templates) and included in HA snapshots.
- **Screenshots** — assets list, asset detail, templates list,
  template editor.

### Technical

- Python 3.13+, async-first, type hints throughout.
- `StorageCollection` + `Store` for persistence (no custom SQL).
- 91 tests passing in HA container (Python 3.14, HA 2026.7.0b2).
- ruff clean; all frontend JS passes `node --check`.
- MIT license.
